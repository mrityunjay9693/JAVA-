Array : An array is a collection of items of similar type at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple 
        items of same type together. Array is the basic data structure to store the multiple information i.e., data 
        under a single variable.  

        Example : arr = [15, 12, 10, 19, 18, 27, 60]; 
                index:   0    1   2   3   4  5   6
                where, 15, 12, 10, 19, 18, 27, 60 are the elements of the array

Note : Java arrays are sero-based indexing i.e., array index started from 0(zero).

Types of Array: In Java, arrays are generally categorised in two types mentioned as below:
                a)One-dimentional array(1-D array)
                b)Multi-dimentional array(2-D array, 3-D... etc)
Note:a)Whenever, we have large quantity of information of same type i.e., data then we use array to store those information.
     b)In array, each element can be uniquely identified by their index. In Java array, index starts from 0(zero) which means
       it is zero based indexing.
     c)In Java , all arrays are dynamically allocated.
     d)It is important to note that, Java arrays are object and its length can be find using the object property "length".
       This is different from C/C++, where "sizeof" is used to find its length.
     e)An array can contain primitives(int, char, etc) type values and object references(non-primitives) of a class depending
       on the definition of array. In case of primitive data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memeory 
       location. And in case of class object, the actual object are stored in a heap segment.
     f)Default values of an array is 0(zero).

Array Declaration(Creating an array): The array declaration has two components namely:
                                      i)Data type 
                                     ii)Variable name.
i)Data type: Data type element will determines the user about what kind of item the array will hold.
ii)Variable name: This is the name given to the respective array.

Syntax 1 :
    Syntax for creating an 1-d array : data_type variable_name[];   or,
                                       data_type[] variable_name; 
                                       
                             Example: int arr[]; //Declaration of an array and "int" represents the array will 
                                                 //hold values of int type.
                                                 
Instantiating Array(Specifying size of an array): We know that array declaration means only a reference of an array is created. 
                                                  To create or givememeory to the array i.e., specifying the size of array, 
                                                  new keyword is used along with type of the array which is followed by a square
                                                  bracket in which size is sepcified. 

Syntax 2 :                                  

Syntax: variable_name = new data_type[size/length];

Example: arr = new int[20]; //allocating memeory to the array.
                                                
Where,* "variable_name" is the name given to the array.
      * "new" keyword is used to allocat memeory to the array.
      * "data_type" specifies/determines/states that what type of data being 
                 allocated to the array and hold by the array.
                                                * "size/length" determines about the number of element or data, the array 
                                                  will hold. Parameter in the square bracket i.e., [] tells us about the 
                                                  size/length of array.

new : The new keyword is used to allocate an array, we must specify the type and size(number of element) to allocate.

-> The element in the array which is allocated by "new" keyword will automatically initialized to some default value such as:

   i) Zero(0) : for numeric.
  ii) false   : for boolean.
 iii) null    : for reference type.
  iv) null    : for String type.
   v) 0.0     : for double 
                                                  
->Combining syntax of line 31 and 43 :

    data_type variable_name[] = new data_type[size/length];
  or,
    data_type[] variable_name = new data_type[size/length];  
                                
  Example :i) int arr[] = new int[10];
           ii)String[] str = new String[5];


->To obtain an array is of two step:
  Step I : Declaring an array of specific data type.
  Step II: Secondly, to allocate the memeory to hold the array, using "new" keyword and assign it to the array variable. 
           Thus, "in Java all arrays are dynamically allocated."            
          
Memory Allocation and Memeory Management : 
  ->Entities created using the "new" keyword, such as object and instances, are allocated on the heap memeory. However not all 
    entities, such as primitive types and local variables, created with "new" will necessarily be allocated in the heap.
  ->  will discuss this topic later.

Q: How to find the length of an array in Java?
Ans: Java provides an important property i.e., the "length" property, which is sued to find out the length of an array.
      Syntax : array_name.length; //read as array name dot length

      Exmple : public class LengthOfArray {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                  int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
                  int lengthOfArray = arr.length;  // -> length property
                  System.out.println("Length of an Array : " + lengthOfArray);
               }

}

Accessing Arrays : Accessingss an array element in Java can be done by using the following loops:
                  a)for loops
                  b)for each loop  
a)for loops: Each element of a array can be accessed using its index. The index of the array begins from 0 and 
             ends at index number "length of array - 1"

    Syntax: for(variable_name = 0; variable_name < arr.length -1; variable_name++/variable_name--)
            {
              //statement to access array's element.                
            }
    Example: 
            public class AccessingArray {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
                for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(arr[i]);
                }
              }
            }

b)for each loop: This is an another way of traversing array or collection in java and it was introduced in java 5. In for-eac loop
                 traversal technque, a variable is directly initialized with the same type as the base type of the array. THe variable
                 can be used to access the array element without any indexing. The value of for-each loop's variable chnages to 
                 successive elements of array after each iteration.

        Syntax: for(type variable_name : array_name)
                {
                  //statement to access value of variable.
                }
