/**
 * Problem: Span Of Array
            1.You are given a number "n", representing the count of elements.
            2.You are given n numbers.
            3.You are required to find the span of inputs. Span is defined as difference of maximum value and
              minimum value.
            4.Return span value
 * Input Format: n (total numbers of element in an array)
                 n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, ... nn.
 * Output Format: spanValue ( maximum value - minimum value)
 * Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10^4 and 0 <= n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, ... n elements <= 10^9
 * Sample Inputs: 6 (n)
                  15, 30, 40, 4, 11, 9
 * Sample OUtput: 36 (40 - 4)
 * Span value = Maximum value - Minimum value
