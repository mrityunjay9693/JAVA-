Function : Function(or, method) in programming is a set of instruction or collection of statement that perform some 
           specific task and return the result. 

          Syntax : <access modifier> <return type> <method/function name>(parameters)
                   {
                        //body
                        //set of instructions 
                        //or, statement
                   }
          Example : public static int addNum(int num1, int num2)  // num1 , num2 : parameters. 
                    {
                        return (num1 + num2);  //set of instructions
                    }
                    here, from line 11 to 13 is the body of function/method.
                          public : Access modifier
                          int : return type
                          addNum : function/method name
    
Note: "main" method is the special function/method in Java which is called upon by code execution.

Types of methods/functions in Java : There are two types of methods in Java which is mentioned as follow: 
                                     a)Predefined methods/functions
                                     b)User-redefined methods/functions
                        
Execution of a function can be done in two ways:
i)Print the result.
ii)Return the result.(i.e., responds)

Notes: a)Whenever our function is executed , its code executes at two places of memory or with the help of two things:
         i)Program stack.(call stack)
         ii)Heap memory.

       b)Whenever our code is executed, two types of memeory is made which is a)call stack(program stack) and b)heap memory

Q: When will the function return back to main at callable line?
Ans: The function constrol will return when: 
     a)forcefully code is terminated and, 
     b)no more line left in function to be executed.
